/root/Desktop/Loot -type f -exec shred -z -u {} \;
The shred command works only on files, so you need to pair it with find and the -exec option to execute shred on all files in the specified directory. As for the shred command itself, the -u option removes the files after they've been overwritten, and the -z flag does a final overwrite pass to hide the fact that shredding took place.

1.2 
rm -r /root/Desktop/Loot 
This command removes the directory.

echo "" > /var/log/auth.log

Enter kill -9 $$
