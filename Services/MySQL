On a lot of systems, you should be able to connect to it as root (the mysql root user) with no password:

 $ mysql -u root

Once you get access to the database, you should be able to navigate it using the following queries:

    show databases;
    use [DATABASE];
    show tables;
    select * from [TABLE];

Where [DATABASE] and [TABLE] should be replaced by the value from the previous queries. 

-----------------------------------------------Login as MYSQL------------------------------------------------

There can exist issues like this one:
- Trivial password.
- The account has a valid shell instead of /bin/false.

This should allow you to log in as the system user mysql.

Once you're logged in, you can get access to the Mysql root password by running strings on the following file: 
/var/lib/mysql/mysql/user.MYD.

You should get 2 passwords:
- debian-sys-maint
- root

The root password is likely splitted into two parts:
    localhost
root*8246FACFAA5BB9CFDCDEAEDA
6c732c6044b7
root
    127.0.0.1
root

    localhost
debian-sys-maint*7B6D59ECDB7B791CF100CA46D0AD911082112351
15DA4067EAA55FBC

The first part is *8246FACFAA5BB9CFDCDEAEDA and the second part is 15DA4067EAA55FBC.
root:*8246FACFAA5BB9CFDCDEAEDA15DA4067EAA55FBC
